		<p>Let us start this off by giving you a little information about myself. My name is Frank Cole Schweers and I am an Atlanta native. I go by Cole instead of Frank because all my brothers go by their middle name. I was born on January 14th, 1997 on a cold dark night. I am part German, Scottish, and Hungarian. I am the youngest of three older brothers, so as you could imagine growing up was tuff.		<p>Alright so let us talk about the flaws within the Star Wars films. So, for sound to travel there must be molecules for it to travel through. There are no molecules in the empty areas between the planets and stars in deep space. So please explain to me how the laser blasters that rebel and empire troops carry make a noise every time they shoot. Also, why would people in that galaxy even use laser blasters when obviously, the ultimate weapon is a light saber. Last, why is Jar Jar Binks even a character in Star Wars? He literally serves no purpose in the movie series what so ever.</p>
		<p>Anyways, my favorite season of the year is Fall. You got to love Fall in Athens. It is the beginning of the football season for the mighty Dawgs (hopefully we will be decent this year). The weather is perfect, not too hot and not too cold. Thanksgiving occurs in the Fall as well which is a holiday where all you do is eat. How awesome is that? </p>

			Here is a picture of Jar Jar Binks. Look how stupid he looks.(I really don't like Jar Jar Binks)
